## 💰 Cost Savings Story

**Without Master Panel:**
- Every transaction needs AI (DeepSeek) to extract entities
- 52 transactions × ₹0.0009 = **₹0.047**
- 10,000 transactions = **₹9.00**

**With Master Panel:**
- 42 transactions matched by exact/fuzzy matching = **FREE**
- Only 10 transactions need AI
- 10 transactions × ₹0.0009 = **₹0.009**
- **Savings: ₹0.038 (80.9%!)**
- 10,000 transactions = **₹1.80** (vs ₹9.00)
- **Save ₹7.20 per 10,000 transactions!**

## 📊 Demo Script (30 seconds)

> "Look at this statement - 52 transactions. See the colors? Each color is a custom entity YOU defined. Blue is Sanchay, green is Business A, purple is Rajat Traders.
>
> 42 out of 52 transactions matched - that's 80%! And these matches are FREE - no AI needed.
>
> Watch - I'll add a new entity... *clicks Add Entity*... Done! Now click Preview... *shows matches*... See? It already found this entity in 5 transactions!
>
> Delete it... *clicks delete*... Gone! Highlighting disappears.
>
> This saves us 80% on AI costs while giving users full control."

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Q: I don't see colors?**
- Hard refresh the page (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+F5)
- Make sure you're viewing the latest statement (job created after restart)

**Q: Entities not showing?**
- Backend must be running (`uvicorn apps.main:app --reload`)
- Frontend must be running (`npm run dev`)
- Check `.cypherx/custom_entities.json` file exists

**Q: Preview shows no matches?**
- Need to process statements AFTER adding entities
- Or use existing entities (Sanchay, Business A, etc.)

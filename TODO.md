# TODO

- [x] Map the statement preview payload to identify the ledger/category column and how it aligns with the legacy master keyword lists.
- [x] Add inline editing for the ledger/category column in the statement preview table with the required confirmation flow.
- [x] Surface master keyword data in the playground UI and keep it in sync when ledger edits are confirmed.
- [x] Summarize the updated statement analysis so the UI reflects ledger changes alongside master keyword updates.
